# Insurance_Claims_analysis
Insurance claims analysis project using Python for data exploration and Power BI for dashboard creation. Includes insights into claims, fraud percentage, incident types, and authorities contacted.
Insurance Claims Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing an insurance claims dataset to find useful insights and patterns related to customer claims and fraud. The work is divided into two parts:

Python (EDA with Seaborn and Matplotlib) – Used for data cleaning, exploring patterns, and understanding distributions.

Power BI Dashboard – Built to give a clear and interactive view of the claims data.

Power BI Dashboard Includes:

Total Claims

Total Claim Amount

% Fraud Cases

Average Claim Amount

Claims by Policy State

Fraud Reported (Yes/No)

Claims Over Time

Incident Types

Authorities Contacted vs Fraud Reported

Tools Used

Python: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Power BI: For visualization and dashboard building

Dataset: Insurance claims data with fraud indicators

How to Use

Open the Jupyter notebook for Python-based analysis.

Open the Power BI file (.pbix) to explore the dashboard.

This project helped in understanding how to analyze insurance data, track fraud cases, and present results in an easy-to-read dashboard format.
